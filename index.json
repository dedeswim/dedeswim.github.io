Evaluating these attacks presents a number of challenges, which the current collection of benchmarks and evaluation techniques do not adequately address. First, there is no clear standard of practice regarding jailbreaking evaluation. Second, existing works compute costs and success rates in incomparable ways. And third, numerous works are not reproducible, as they withhold adversarial prompts, involve closed-source code, or rely on evolving proprietary APIs. To address these challenges, we introduce JailbreakBench, an open-sourced benchmark with the following components: (1) a new jailbreaking dataset containing 100 unique behaviors, which we call JBB-Behaviors; (2) an evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts, which we refer to as jailbreak artifacts; (3) a standardized evaluation framework that includes a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions; and (4) a leaderboard that tracks the performance of attacks and defenses for various LLMs. We have carefully considered the potential ethical implications of releasing this benchmark, and believe that it will be a net positive for the community. Over time, we will expand and adapt the benchmark to reflect technical and methodological advances in the research community.","tags":[],"title":"JailbreakBench: An Open Robustness Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edoardo Debenedetti","Nicholas Carlini","Florian Tramèr"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704555196,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704555196,"objectID":"bf3f4dc9b217df79ec7212471987edae","permalink":"https://edoardo.science/publication/breaking_eggs/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T15:33:16Z","relpermalink":"/publication/breaking_eggs/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new real-world oriented metric for black-box decision-based attacks on security-critical systems","tags":["Distinguished Paper Award Runner-up"],"title":"Evading Black-box Classifiers Without Breaking Eggs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edoardo Debenedetti","Giorgio Severi","Nicholas Carlini","Christopher A.

In this work, we introduce privacy side channels: attacks that exploit these system-level components to extract private information at far higher rates than is otherwise possible for standalone models. We propose four categories of side channels that span the entire ML lifecycle (training data filtering, input preprocessing, output post-processing, and query filtering) and allow for either enhanced membership inference attacks or even novel threats such as extracting users' test queries. For example, we show that deduplicating training data before applying differentially-private training creates a side-channel that completely invalidates any provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, we show that systems which block language models from regenerating training data can be exploited to allow exact reconstruction of private keys contained in the training set -- even if the model did not memorize these keys. Taken together, our results demonstrate the need for a holistic, end-to-end privacy analysis of machine learning.","tags":[],"title":"Privacy Side Channels in Machine Learning Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edoardo Debenedetti","Vikash Sehwag","Prateek Mittal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1663687996,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663687996,"objectID":"fbb2b56df6505044500f810a7c069bff","permalink":"https://edoardo.science/publication/light_recipe/","publishdate":"2022-09-20T15:33:16Z","relpermalink":"/publication/light_recipe/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper shows that ViTs are highly suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance and recommends that the community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of adversarial training.","tags":[],"title":"A Light Recipe to Train Robust Vision Transformers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edoardo Debenedetti"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1652358837,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652358837,"objectID":"0f40cf545adf79432be77d9037b7794b","permalink":"https://edoardo.science/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T12:33:57Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"My Master's thesis done at EPFL under the supervision of Princeton's Vikash Sehwag and Prof. Prateek Mittal, and EPFL's Prof. Troncoso.

A key challenge in benchmarking robustness is that its evaluation is often error-prone leading to robustness overestimation. Our goal is to establish a standardized benchmark of adversarial robustness, which as accurately as possible reflects the robustness of the considered models within a reasonable computational budget. To this end, we start by considering the image classification task and introduce restrictions (possibly loosened in the future) on the allowed models and evaluate adversarial robustness with AutoAttack, an ensemble of white- and black-box attacks, which was recently shown in a large-scale study to improve almost all robustness evaluations compared to the original publications. To prevent overadaptation of new defenses to AutoAttack, we welcome external evaluations based on adaptive attacks, especially where AutoAttack flags a potential overestimation of robustness. Our leaderboard, hosted at https://robustbench.github.io/, contains evaluations of 120+ models and aims at reflecting the current state of the art in image classification on a set of well-defined tasks in $\\ell_2$- and $\\ell_\\infty$-threat models and on common corruptions, with possible extensions in the future. Additionally, we open-source the library https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench that provides unified access to 80+ robust models to facilitate their downstream applications. Finally, based on the collected models, we analyze the impact of robustness on the performance on distribution shifts, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, fairness, privacy leakage, smoothness, and transferability.
