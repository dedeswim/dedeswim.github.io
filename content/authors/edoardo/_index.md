I am a **Computer Science Ph.D. Student** at ETH ZÃ¼rich in the [Secure and Private AI (SPY) Lab](https://spylab.ai), advised by [Florian TramÃ¨r](https://floriantramer.com). I am also a Student Researcher in the ML Red Team at Google, working with Tianqi Fan and [Ilia Shumailov](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~is410/). I am interested in the security and privacy of machine learning *systems*. Most recently, I have been [looking into](https://agentdojo.spylab.ai) the security of LLM Agents.

My research is supported by a [CYD Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/research/funding/epfl-programmes/cyd/cyd-phd/) awarded by the [armasuisse Cyber-Defence Campus](https://www.cydcampus.ch/).

Prior to my PhD, I earned a Computer Science M.Sc. at [**EPFL**](https://epfl.ch/en) and a Computer Engineering B.Sc. at the [**Polytechnic University of Turin**](https://www.polito.it/).

Outside of my studies, I interned as a SWE intern at **[Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/)** and as a Research Intern at the armasuisse CYD Campus, supervised by [Prof. Humbert](https://www.mhumbert.com/).

More information can be found on my [CV](/files/cv.pdf), last updated on 2024/10/20. For a more recent one, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:edoardo.debenedetti@inf.ethz.ch).

In my freetime, I like all things outdoors, from hiking, to skiing, sailing, and climbing.
