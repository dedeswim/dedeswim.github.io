I am a **Computer Science Ph.D. Student** at ETH ZÃ¼rich in the [Secure and Private AI (SPY) Lab](https://spylab.ai), advised by [Florian TramÃ¨r](https://floriantramer.com). I am interested in the security and privacy of machine learning *systems*. Most recently, I have been looking into the security of LLM Agents. Currently, I am also a Research Scientist Intern at Meta, in the GenAI Red Team, working on AI agents security.

Prior to my PhD, I earned a Computer Science M.Sc. at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch/en) and a Computer Engineering B.Sc. at the [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/).

Outside of my studies, I was Student Researcher in the AI Red Team at Google, I interned as a SWE intern at Bloomberg LP, and as a Research Intern at the armasuisse CYD Campus.

More information can be found on my [CV](/files/cv.pdf), last updated on 2025/19/08. For a more recent one, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:edoardo.debenedetti@inf.ethz.ch).

In my free time, I like all things outdoors, from hiking, to (backcountry) skiing, and sailing.
