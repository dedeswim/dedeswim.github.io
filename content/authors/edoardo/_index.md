I am a **Computer Science Ph.D. Student** at ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by [Florian TramÃ¨r](https://floriantramer.com). My interest is in how the current (and future) research about the security and privacy of machine learning systems can be applied to real-world systems. My aim is to understand what the threat models look like in the real-world, and, based on that, understand which attacks are feasible, and what defenses are most effective.

I earned a **Computer Science M.Sc.** at [**EPFL**](https://epfl.ch/en), with a strong focus on **Machine Learning and Security**, and a Computer Engineering B.Sc. at [**PoliTo**](https://www.polito.it/). I did my Master thesis about the robustness of Vision Transformers supervised by Princeton University's [Prof. Mittal](http://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/), and I am one of the co-authors and maintainers of **[RobustBench](https://robustbench.github.io)**, a standardized benchmark for adversarial robustness.

I had internship experiences at **[Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/)**, as an SWE intern, and at [armasuisse CYD Campus](https://www.ar.admin.ch/en/armasuisse-wissenschaft-und-technologie-w-t/cyber-defence_campus.html), as a Research Intern, supervised by [Prof. Humbert](https://www.mhumbert.com/).

I attended [**Military Navy College** "F. Morosini"](http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/training_institute/morosini/Pagine/default.aspx), in Venice, I am a member of [LeadTheFuture](https://leadthefuture.tech), the leading mentoring program for STEM students in Italy, and I have been junior entrepreneur at [JEToP](https://jetop.com).
