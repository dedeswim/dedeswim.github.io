[Hello there](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hello-there)! I am **Edoardo**, a **Computer Science M.Sc.** student at [**EPFL**](https://epfl.ch/en), with a strong focus on **Machine Learning and Security**. I earned a Computer Engineering B.Sc. at [**PoliTo**](https://www.polito.it/), after spending my sophomore year as an exchange student at [Tongji University (**同济大学**)](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, supported by [PoliTong](https://www.polito.it/international/partnership/politecnico_nel_mondo/politong/index.php?lang=en) scholarship.

I am currently working on a **research project** about **deepfakes counteraction** with **[Prof. Troncoso](http://carmelatroncoso.com/)** at EPFL's [SPRING Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/spring/).

I interned at the IT Consulting firm Blue Reply, part of **Reply Group**, working on **RPA** and on the development of a **chatbot**.

I am highly curiosity-driven and my goal is to become an **ML Research Scientist**, after pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

I attended [**Military Navy College** "F. Morosini"](http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/training_institute/morosini/Pagine/default.aspx), in Venice. There, I lead sophomores as **prefect** during my final year, and I received **military training** aboard Italian Navy's units and at Italian Navy's Marine Corps.

I am also swimming, sailing, and travel addicted. I like to call myself a *beta tester*.
