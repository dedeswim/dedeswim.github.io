**[06/2023 - New paper: *Privacy Side Channels in Machine Learning Systems*]**  We have a new paper, about side-channels in ML *systems*, i.e., by exploiting components other than the model. Spoiler alert: some of those components, on paper, are meant to **improve** privacy! Take a look [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05610)!

**[06/2023 - New paper: *Evading Black-box Classifiers Without Breaking Eggs*]**  We uploaded on arXiv a new paper, where we propose a new real-world oriented metric for black-box decision-based attacks on security-critical systems. Take a look [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02895)!

**[11/2022 - *A Light Recipe to Train Robust Vision Transformers* accepted at SaTML]** The paper derived from my master thesis was accepted at the [IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning](https://satml.org) (SaTML). I'm looking forward to presenting my paper in February!

**[09/2022 - New paper: *A Light Recipe to Train Robust Vision Transformers*]**  We uploaded on arXiv the paper derived from my Master's thesis, with additional experiments and insights. Take a look [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07399)!

**[08/2022 - I started my PhD]** On August 1st, 2022, I started my PhD at ETH Zürich, in the Privacy and Security Lab of Prof. [Florian Tramèr](https://floriantramer.com).

**[12/05/2022 - I earned my MSc at EPFL!]** On April 27th I successfully defended my MSc thesis about Adversarially Robust Vision Transformers! You can read it [here](/publication/thesis/). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about it!
