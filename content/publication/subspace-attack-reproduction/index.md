abstract: "As part of the NeurIPS 2019 Reproducibility Challenge, we chose to attempt to reproduce the attack algorithm proposed in \"Subspace Attack: Exploiting Promising Subspaces for Query-Efficient Black-box Attacks\". Our reported results are better than the original paper in terms of the median number of queries per attack, but worse in terms of failure rate. A concise assessment of our implementation is also included."
